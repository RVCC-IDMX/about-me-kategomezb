# About Me

/*Biography*/

I knew that I wanted to do something different. That is why I decided to use a flip card that can show a little bit of my personal information and I knew that it would benefit my website visually.

In my code I used a display so I could align and position the content of the flip card. I also used the transform property to flip the card over on hover. Additionally, I added the box-shadow property to add a shadow effect to the card and the background property to add gradient backgrounds to both sides of the card.

/*My Hobbies*/

This section was really hard because I did not want it to be simple. I got the images from https://www.flaticon.com/, so it would give my section a different style insted of just text. In the CSS stylesheet it includes rules for the layout and appearance of my "hobbies" section, as well as rules for a "skills" section with clickable boxes displaying icons and text. I also included the responsive design rules to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
