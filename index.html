            </div>
            <p>I like photography because it has made me fall in love with light and see the world around me with fresh eyes every day. Taking photos is something I can do anytime, anywhere and all I need is my phone.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Every time I adventure into open worlds to make decisions constantly and every time I incarnate with characters that are not real, I consider that we are exploring our personality and knowing a part of ourselves as people of integrity.</p>

    <h3>My Video</h3>
    <p>We are so used to the pace of life we lead, doing our routines, doing all kinds of activities, believing that everything is going well and everything is under control, but what we do not know is that we are on autopilot without realizing that. STOP, is the key, stop doing what I am doing and try to be more aware about how I feel and what is going through my mind at that moment and decide to continue or change. By making a stop we understand the basis of things and how to handle them and only when we understand what the origin is, is when we can begin to transform them and make them useful to us. And the question is: Do we feel good being where we are? That's what we really want for our life? Do we want to stay there or do we look for a change? What are we doing then to change that?</p>
    <p>The problem or the cause is then in what I tell myself and not in what others tell me, then we have to do a job of going inside and being honest with ourselves, only then will we be able to make real changes. Maybe we do not like to analyze ourselves because we do not want or cannot see who we really are, but we must recognize that in my personality there are things where I need help from another to find that part of the tool I need for myself.</p>

    <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
    <div>
        <p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.</p>

<p>“Can you come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.</p>

<p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</p>

<p>“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”</p>

<p>“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?”</p>

<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.</p>

<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”</p>
